# CalcuExpression

CalcuExpression is a calculator application built in C# using Windows Forms. It is designed to handle a variety of mathematical operations, including basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, logarithms, square roots, exponentiation, and more. The application allows for the use of variables and can evaluate complex mathematical expressions.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Support for trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)
- Natural logarithm and logarithm to base 10
- Square root and exponentiation
- Handling of mathematical expressions with variables
- Factorial and percentage calculations
- User-friendly interface with clear distinction between variable definition and expression evaluation
